Step,Process
Sender,
1,Relevant Arduino and CPP libraries are imported and varaibles are initialized. 
2,LoRa and serial connection is initialized. 
3,The accelerometer is calibrated and zero values are set for each axis. 
4,The raw acceleration is sampled and processed. 
5,The maximum acceleration is found. 
6,Low pass filter is applied to the acceleration values. 
7,FFT is computed and the peak frequency is found. 
8,NaN values are converted to 0. 
9,Max acceleration and frequency values for each axis are converted to bytes and sent via LoRa packet. 
Receiver,
10,Relevant Arduino and CPP libraries are imported and varaibles are initialized. 
11,LoRa and serial connection is initialized. 
12,Check whether there is a LoRa packet to read. The code loops until there is an available packet. 
13,When there is an available packet the frequency and acceleration values are decoded and printed. 
Logging ,
14,Relevant Python modules are imported and serial connection is initialized. 
15,The user enters the name of the log file. 
16,Check whether there is serial data to read. The code loops until there is available data. 
17,When there is data available it is parsed and validated. 
18,Once validated the data is appended to a list and the serial connection is terminated. 
19,The serial data is written to the specified file. 
Plotting,
20,Relevant Python modules are imported.
21,The user enters the name of the log file and the plot file. 
22,The data from the log file is read and plotted. 
23,The plots are saved with the specified file names and displayed to the user.
