Step,Process
1,Relevant Arduino and CPP libraries are imported and variables are initialized. 
2,Connection to Arduino Cloud is established. 
3,The accelerometer is calibrated and zero values are set for each axis. 
4,The main loop starts and the Arduino Cloud is updated. 
5,The raw acceleration is sampled and processed. 
6,The maximum acceleration is found. 
7,Low pass filter is applied to the acceleration values. 
8,FFT is computed and the peak frequency is found. 
9,NaN values are converted to 0. 
10,Current max acceleration and frequency values are added to a running total. 
11,The loop iteration value is incremented. 
12,The time passed is checked. If less than timer value the loop resets. 
13,If the time passed is equal to or greater than the timer value then the averages of the running total values are found using the loop iteration value. 
14,The average values are printed and assigned to their respective cloud variables.
15,Total values and loop iteration values are reset and the loop is restarted.
