\section{Expected Project Outcomes}

The expected outcomes of this project exist in the form of deliverables that are required to achieve the project aims. The first outcome of this project is a functioning prototype of the IoT system. In this version, the sensor nodes will be implemented on breadboards and powered externally using a power supply. This outcome is satisfied once objectives one, two and three have been achieved. These objectives are achieved once the following system requirements have been verified. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The gateway shall receive packets from a sensor node 600m away.
\item The system shall communicate on the 925MHz frequency.
\item The system software shall include a sufficient sampling rate and windowing technique for the Fourier Transform such that the analog data is successfully discretized. 
\end{enumerate}

The second outcome is version one of the system. Version one includes implementation on a PCB carrier board, solar power and a 3D-printed enclosure. This outcome is satisfied once objectives four, five and six have been achieved. System version one is achieved when the following system requirements have been verified. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system shall transmit and receive packets every hour. 
\item The system shall be always on and always operational. 
\item The system shall be resistant to water damage and overheating. 
\item The system shall successfully aggregate data on the TNN Cloud.
\end{enumerate}
