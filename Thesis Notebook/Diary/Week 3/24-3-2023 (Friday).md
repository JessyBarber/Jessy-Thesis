# Notes 
- [ ] What do we need for lab test?
	- [ ] What sampling intervals?
- [ ] Need gateway to transmit via LoRa
- [ ] Code keeps crashing 
- [ ] FFT is easy to do just need gateway -> can transmit data serially
- [ ] Crashing after 3 prints -> memory error somewhere 
- [ ] Base sampling rate from vibrating beam frequency
- [ ] Week 5 experiment 
- [ ] Forget about the gateway just have two 1300 talk to each other -> supposedly don't need gateway & don't worry about cloud until after experimental setup 
- [x] CH340 USB driver âœ… 2023-03-25
	- This looked pretty sketchy and isn't actually a chip on the MKR WAN 1300
- [ ] Meeting next Wednesday ðŸ“… (@10:00 29-03-2023)
- [ ] Look into what the maximum sampling rate for the device is 
- [ ] And max values for accel
